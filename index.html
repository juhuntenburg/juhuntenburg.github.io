        <h4>background</h4>
        <p>The human brain has been described in terms of a network with distinct features such as a small-world topology, modularity, the existence of hubs and a rich-club (rev in Bullmore &amp Sporns 2009, 2012). Complementary to the topological description, a characteristic spatial layout of cortical networks and their relationship to anatomical landmarks is emerging from connectivity based parcellation studies (e.g. Yeo et al., 2011). However, most of these studies investigate the adult human brain and little is known about factors leading to this particular organization throughout brain development. Existing studies of connectivity in infants and even preterm neonates indicate the presence of major topological and spatial features resembling the adult brain already at this stage of development (rev in Dubois, Kostovic &amp Judas 2015). Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the characteristic connectivity patterns start emerging during embryonic or early fetal development, long before term. Investigating this period empirically in humans is difficult and does not allow for experimental manipulations. Computational modelling presents an alternative approach, making it possible to study the interaction of different factors during early brain development and their effect on the resulting connectivity patterns.</p>
        <h4>idea</h4>
        <p>In previous studies, a simple model of the cortical surface was used to simulate mechanical forces during cortical growth. It was demonstrated that basic elastoplastic properties of the model are sufficient to produce folding patterns sharing main characteristics with those observed in the brain (Toro&Burnod 2005, Toro 2012). The goal here is to extend the morphogenetic model to simulate the development of cortico-cortical connections in interaction with concomitant cortical growth, folding &amp regionalization. The wiring rule is distance based with a probabilistic element. At each time step of the progressing cortical growth the euclidian distance between all nodes on the surface is evaluated and if the distance is below a given threshold, a connection is established with a given probability. The length of the established connections increases as the model grows, however, new connections will still only be established between proximal nodes. Importantly, as the model grows new nodes are established on the surface to keep the node density approximately stable. This means, that 1) earlier forming connections should on average be longer than those being established later in time 2) earlier forming nodes should on average have more connections than later forming ones.</p>
        <p>The assumption of distance dependent wiring is derived from observations in real brain networks where connection length follows a gamma shaped distribution, with shorter connections being much more abundant than longer ones (e.g. Braitenberg &amp Schuez 1998, Kaiser et al., 2009, humans?). Under this rule it is intuitive that growth and folding of the modelled cortical surface will impact on the resulting connectivity pattern. An issue that needs to be addressed once the surface starts folding is to ensure that only trajectories through the inner space of the model are considered when establishing new connections, so that no anatomically implausible connections through sulci will appear.</p>
        <p>Another factor that is likely to play a role during the development of cortico-cortical connections is the early regionalization of the cortex into areas of distinct architectonic differentiation (Goldman-Rakic, 1980, Pandya&Sanides, 1973, etc). Gradients or step changes in the mechanical properties of the surface are an option to model the impact of structural differences in distinct areas on cortical folding and thereby on the resulting connectivity patterns (Toro &amp Burnod, 2005). Alternatively, regionalization can be conceptualized in the temporal domain, based on evidence indicating that different cortical regions show different time courses of connection growth during development (Rakic 2002). Previous approaches to model overlapping temporal windows as a factor increasing the likelihood of establishing a connection have shown encouraging results on the level of single neurons (Kaiser &amp Hilgetag, 2007, Lim et al., 2015). Possibly, mechanical and temporal approaches to model the impact of early regionalization on connectivity patterns can be combined.
        </p>
        <p>Once a working implementation of the model in 2D exists first analyses can be performed (see below). It is however the goal to advance the model into 3D space.</p>
        <h4>analyses &amp data</h4>
        <p>data: Jessica Dubois, Ferret, C.elegans</p>
        <h4>possible extensions</h4>
        <p>From here, different extensions are conceivable. In the basic implementation all connections are straight lines. This has several implications: 1) with increasing folding the possibility to establish a straight connection between two nodes that completely lies within the model rapdily decreases, 2) existing connections do not deform along with the surface, and overall 3) no information about the actual trajectory of the connection in space is provided. Moreover, the model is deterministic, i.e. a connection either exists or does not exist. To address these potential limitations a different approach to modelling the connections could be to describe the entire space within the model in terms of small volume elements with diffusion tensors. Connections are then established depending on the shortest path through these elements and therefore not necessarily straight. If a connection is established, the tensors of all elements it passes are updated according to the direction of the connection. In the end, the actual network is derived using a tract tracing algorithm on the tensors. This would represent a more probabilistic approach and provide geometrically meaningful connectivity.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the network derived from the model might be used as a structural basis to simulate functional dynamics and interactions of connected areas (in collaboration with Guillaume Dumas?). In that case, it would be possible to observe how the pattern of functional networks changes in the evolving model. Here, an even more complex growth model, integrating the increasing fibre myelination and their impact on signal transduction, could provide another important perspective on the development of functional networks.</p>
